# Fuzzy-Based-Traffic-Light-Control-System
This project focuses on creating an intelligent Fuzzy Logic-based Traffic Light Control System to address the inefficiencies of traditional fixed-timer traffic light systems. By utilizing fuzzy logic, this system dynamically adjusts the duration of traffic signals based on real-time traffic density and waiting times, ensuring smoother traffic flow and reducing congestion. It takes into account input variables such as traffic density (categorized as low, medium, or high) and waiting time at the signal (short, medium, or long) to calculate the optimal signal duration for each lane.

The system architecture involves collecting real-time data through sensors, fuzzifying the input values into fuzzy sets, applying a set of fuzzy rules through an inference engine, and finally defuzzifying the results into actionable durations for the traffic lights. The approach allows for adaptive control that minimizes idle time and optimizes traffic flow, especially during peak hours.

The project is implemented using MATLAB or Python, leveraging the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and traffic simulation tools for testing and validation. It is designed to improve urban traffic management systems and pave the way for smarter, more efficient cities. To run the project, clone the repository, install the required libraries, and follow the provided instructions to simulate and observe the results.
